# LED_Gloves
In this project, I created a pair of gloves which flash to the beat of your dance moves. With the intention of using these at a festival, I did not feel that piezo elements (which measure acoustics/ vibrations) would be suitable. Instead, I thought it would be more robust if acceleration was measured. Relying on the motion of the users hands rather than the amplitude of the music would allow them to dance with phone speakers, all the way to concerts/ festivals with no need to recalibrate the equipment.
